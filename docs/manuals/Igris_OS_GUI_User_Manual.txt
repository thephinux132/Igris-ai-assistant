The Igris Control GUI is the main interface for interacting with the Igris OS. It allows you to manage plugins, configure settings, and communicate with the Igris Desktop Environment.

1. Getting Started
Launching the GUI: Execute igris_control_gui_main_final_fixed_importlib_patch_patched.py using Python.
Initial Setup: On first launch, the GUI will prompt you for a username. This is used for logging and personalization.
2. Core Interface Elements
The GUI is divided into several key areas:

Chat Area: This is the main display area, showing your interactions with the AI, plugin outputs, and system messages.
Input Field: Located at the bottom, type your commands here and press Enter to send.
Status Bar: Displays the current status of the system (e.g., "Ready", "Executing...", "Error").
Error Area: If any errors occur, they will be displayed in the Error area, above the chat window.
Menu Bar: The Menu Bar provides access to a number of functions, as outlined below.
Network Dashboard: You can find valuable information about your network here.
3. Menu Bar Options
File Menu
Export Chat...: Saves the current chat log to a text file.
Import Chat...: Loads a chat log from a text file.
Exit: Closes the GUI.
Tools Menu
Run Plugin...: Opens a window to select and run any plugin located in the plugins directory.
Run Daily Checkup: Executes a series of diagnostic checks and displays a report.
Edit Policy File...: Opens a text editor to modify the ai_script_policy.json file.
Memory Manager: Opens a separate window to view and manage the AI's stored conversation history.
Options Menu
Auto-Execute Matched Tasks: When enabled, the GUI will automatically run commands that the AI matches to known tasks.
Enable Text-to-Speech: Enables spoken feedback for user input, AI responses, and alerts.
Enforce Admin Auth: This option enables stricter security checks.
Theme: Select from a variety of UI themes.
4. Interacting with the System
Typing Commands: Enter your requests in the input field and press Enter. The GUI will send these requests to the AI for processing.
Command History: Use the Up and Down arrow keys to cycle through previously entered commands.
5. Using Plugins
Running Plugins: Select "Run Plugin..." from the Tools menu to open the Plugin window.
Selecting a Plugin: Use the Combobox to filter the plugins by group, then double-click a plugin from the list to run it. The plugin's description will show in the description column.
Plugin Output: The plugin's output will be displayed in the main Chat Area.
Running Autorun Plugins: To configure plugins to run automatically on start-up, modify ai_script_policy.json and add the plugin names to the autorun_plugins list.
6. Security
The system enforces security by requiring authentication for certain tasks.
When a task requires admin privileges, the GUI will prompt you to authenticate using fingerprint, PIN, or voice recognition.
7. Network Dashboard
This tab provides a visual dashboard for network monitoring, including live hosts, open ports, and active connections.
Use the buttons on the top to perform the appropriate task.
Parsing of results is rudimentary and depends on output format of the scripts themselves.
